            ## Platform.sh docs

            ![Overview of Platform.sh docs](/psh-docs-intro.png)

            Note:
            * Platform as a Service
            * Docs completely open source
            * Build on Hugo
            * Have a lot of content
            ---
            ## What it's about

            * Content reuse
            * Single sourcing
            * Transclusion

            Note:
            * Some names for the same thing
            * We have lots of content
            * Reuse it
            * Also know as creating a single source of truth
            * Transclusion is the inclusion of files within other files
            ---
            ## Content reuse

            * Avoid repetition
            * Update once, correct everywhere
            * Helps with automation
            * Same content, different outputs

            Note:
            * Helps you avoid repetition
            * Reduces the need to make multiple updates
            * Can have automation update one source and publish that elsewhere
            * Maybe want PDFs with different variable names
            ---
            ## Examples

            * Updating a product name
            * Installation instructions
            * Intro to different integrations

            Note:
            * Some examples where this could come in handy
            * A product name changing and existing on many pages
            * Instructions in getting started and a specific page
            * We have guides for lots of different frameworks and they share introductory and other content

            ## Example repetition

            ```markdown
            To get the most out of your Task Manager,
            integrate it with Project X.
            This makes it faster, cleaner, and smarter.

            To do so, follow these steps:

            1. Set up your directory with the following command:
               `project start`.
            2. Answer the questions.
            3. Build it all by running `project build`.
            ```

            ```markdown
            To get the most out of your Calendar,
            integrate it with Project X.
            This makes it faster, cleaner, and smarter.

            To do so, follow these steps:

            1. Set up your directory with the following command:
               `project start`.
            2. Answer the questions.
            3. Build it all by running `project build`.
            ```

            Note:
            * You might have similar instructions in two places
            * You repeat your product name and how to use it
            ---
            ## Resolve project name

            ```markdown
            To get the most out of your Task Manager,
            integrate it with {{% product-x %}}.
            This makes it faster, cleaner, and smarter.

            To do so, follow these steps:

            1. Set up your directory with the following command:
               `project start`.
            2. Answer the questions.
            3. Build it all by running `project build`.
            ```

            ```markdown

            integrate it with {{% product-x %}}.
