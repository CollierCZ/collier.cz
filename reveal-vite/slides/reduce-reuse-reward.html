            ## Platform.sh docs

            ![Overview of Platform.sh docs](/psh-docs-intro.png)

            Note:
            * Platform as a Service
            * Docs completely open source
            * Build on Hugo
            * Have a lot of content
            ---
            ## What it's all About

            * Why reuse
            * How to reuse
            * What to be careful of

            ---
            ## What it's called

            * Content reuse
            * Single sourcing
            * Transclusion

            Note:
            * Some names for the same thing
            * We have lots of content
            * Reuse it
            * Also know as creating a single source of truth
            * Transclusion is the inclusion of files within other files
            ---
            ## Benefits to reuse

            * Avoid repetition (DRY principle)
            * Update once, correct everywhere
            * Helps with automation
            * Same content, different outputs

            Note:
            * Helps you avoid repetition
            * Reduces the need to make multiple updates
            * Can have automation update one source and publish that elsewhere
            * Maybe want PDFs with different variable names
            ---
            ## Examples

            * Updating a product name
            * Installation instructions
            * Introduction to different integrations

            Note:
            * Some examples where this could come in handy
            * A product name changing and existing on many pages
            * Instructions in getting started and a specific page
            * We have guides for lots of different frameworks and they share introductory and other content
            ---
            ## Example repetition

            ```markdown
            To get the most out of your Task Manager,
            integrate it with Project X.
            This makes it faster, cleaner, and smarter.

            To do so, follow these steps:

            1. Set up your directory with the following command:
               `project start`.
            2. Answer the questions.
            3. Build it all by running `project build`.
            ```

            ```markdown
            To get the most out of your Calendar,
            integrate it with Project X.
            This makes it faster, cleaner, and smarter.

            To do so, follow these steps:

            1. Set up your directory with the following command:
               `project start`.
            2. Answer the questions.
            3. Build it all by running `project build`.
            ```

            Note:
            * You might have similar instructions in two places
            * You repeat your product name and how to use it
            ---
            ## Resolve project name

            Create a `layouts/shortcodes/product-name.md` file:

            ```markdown
            Project X
            ```

            Note:
            * Then you can resolve the name in a short code.
            * When you change it here, it changes in every place
            * Could also use HTML
            ---
            ## Use the shortcode

            ```markdown
            To get the most out of your Task Manager,
            integrate it with {{% product-name %}}.
            This makes it faster, cleaner, and smarter.

            To do so, follow these steps:

            1. Set up your directory with the following command:
               `project start`.
            2. Answer the questions.
            3. Build it all by running `project build`.
            ```

            ```markdown
            To get the most out of your Calendar,
            integrate it with {{% product-name %}}.
            This makes it faster, cleaner, and smarter.

            To do so, follow these steps:

            1. Set up your directory with the following command:
               `project start`.
            2. Answer the questions.
            3. Build it all by running `project build`.
            ```
            ---
            ## Reuse instructions

            ```markdown
            {{% setup-instructions integration="Task Manager"%}}
            ```

            ```markdown
            {{% setup-instructions integration="Calendar"%}}
            ```

            Create a `layouts/shortcodes/setup-instructions.md` file:
            ```markdown
            {{ $integration = .Get "integration"}}
            To get the most out of your {{ $integration }},
            integrate it with {{% product-name %}}.
            This makes it faster, cleaner, and smarter.

            To do so, follow these steps:

            1. Set up your directory with the following command:
               `project start`.
            2. Answer the questions.
            3. Build it all by running `project build`.
            ```

            Note:
            * It's possible to put it into a shortcode
            * Use a named property to vary part of the content
            ---
            ## Vary instructions

            ```markdown
            {{ $integration = .Get "integration"}}
            To get the most out of your {{ $integration }},
            integrate it with {{% product-name %}}.
            This makes it faster, cleaner, and smarter.

            To do so, follow these steps:

            1. Set up your directory with the following command:
               `project
               {{if eq $integration "Task Manager"}}start{{else}}go{{end}}`.
            2. Answer the questions.
            3. Build it all by running `project build`.
            ```

            Note:
            * It's possible to put it into a shortcode
            * Use a named property to vary part of the content
            ---
            ## Nested shortcodes

            One issue is you can't use shortcodes inside other shortcodes.

            Make the nested shortcode into a partial.
            Then your top-level shortcode could look like:
            ```markdown
            {{ $integration = .Get "integration"}}
            To get the most out of your {{ $integration }},
            integrate it with
            {{ partial "product-name" (dict "integration" $integration) }}.
            This makes it faster, cleaner, and smarter.

            To do so, follow these steps:

            1. Set up your directory with the following command:
               `project start`.
            2. Answer the questions.
            3. Build it all by running `project build`.
            ```

            Note:
            * Can create partials to have nesting
            * This adds complexity
            * Makes it harder to update
            ---
            ## Sustainable organization

            If you have a lot of reused content, can be difficult to organize.
            Especially if you have other shortcodes for actual layouts and such.

            Can create a shortcode to transclude markdown files from a special directory just for them.
            Can have separate files inside this.

            ---
            ## Example `include` shortcode

            If your directory for the files was `snippets`,
            your shortcode could look like this:
            ```markdown
            {{ $file := .Get 0 }}
            {{ printf "snippets/%s" $file | readFile | safeHTML }}
            ```

            And you could invoke it like this (assuming the file to include is `example.md` in the `snippets` directory):
            ```markdown
            {{% include "example.md" %}}
            ```

            Note:
            * safeHTML ensures headings are included in Table of Contents
            ---
            ## Drawbacks

            * Doesn't process Hugo formatting (no variables or partials)
            * If outside content directory, updates don't refresh site

            So suitable for basic markdown that's repeated, but not complex scenarios.

            ## Things to watch out for

            Anna Gasparyan â€“ [Don't shoot yourself in the foot with content reuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxEhvjz3eEY)

            * Content reused when unnecessary
            * Hard to find where to update (especially nested)
            * Complex nesting can break
            * Reused content can hurt search results

            Just because you _can_ reuse content doesn't mean you _should_.
            DRY versus KISS principles.
