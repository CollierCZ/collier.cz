I grew up in [Lexington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Massachusetts)
and now live in [Brno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno), right in the heart of Central Europe.
I work as a technical writer at [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh),
focusing on their [open source documentation](https://docs.platform.sh).

In addition to technical and educational writing,
I also do editing of English texts and translations from Czech or Slovak into English.
In this way, I help people express things as they want to be heard.

I'm also one of the founders of [Czech Theater](https://czechtheater.cz/),
an amateur community theater that presents Czech plays in English so they'll be accessible to people who can't understand Czech.
We help to bridge gaps between cultures.
